Make it so that if one AutoRun fails with abort_on_fail == true
    then no more autoruns are ran, and the original executing
    function will not execute
    
Make a parameter on the deserialization functions & Configurable
    trait that is a bool which indicates if the file should be
    created if it is not found.  Maybe make deserialization
    functions return a Result.

Improve error handling, replace expects and unwraps in the 
    Configurable implementations with actual error handling












NOTES:

    
maybe add a __ prefix that sjpild be skipped if present in an env var
    or maybe add a list of env vars to skip in the
    GlobalInstall / GlobalUser structs
